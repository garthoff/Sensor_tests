/* light detector (photocell)
 *
 * based on code from www.ladyada.net/learn/sensors/cds.html
 *
 * one leg of photocell connected to 5V
 * the other connected to analog input (here, pin 5)
 *     as well as a 10k pull-down resistor connected to ground
 * 
 * when very dark:   photo sensor has 200k ohm resistance
 * when very bright: photo sensor has  10k ohm resistance
 * if totally dark, connected to ground
 *
 * for better discrimination in brighter light, use a 1k ohm resistor
 * (but this would give less sensitivity in dim light)
 *
 * have LED attached to pin 11; lit brighter when photocell reads darker
